# Assets

These are empty asset definitions for the animations and sounds used by the SM64 script.<br/>
The animations define some metadata such as:

* How many frames the animation is
* Whether an animation should loop or freeze at the end
* The address of the animation data in the SM64 (USA) ROM.
* What the upload hash of the asset is (empty)

Sounds can be configuration objects with named sound attributes defining their weight of being rolled.
