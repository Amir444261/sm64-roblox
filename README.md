# sm64-roblox
Partial source/tools to an unpublished port of SM64's movement code into Roblox.<br/>
Based on the decompilation project hosted at: https://github.com/n64decomp/sm64

I wanted to make this public as a curiousity for anyone who wanted to know how I pulled it off. I do want to bring this back online at some point, but I need to commission someone to remake the animations so I don't have to rip them from the SM64 ROM.
