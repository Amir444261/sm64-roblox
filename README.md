# sm64-roblox
Partial source/tools to an unpublished port of SM64's movement code into Roblox.

This does not contain everything needed to get this up and running again, but I wanted to make this public as a curiousity for anyone who wanted to know how I pulled it off.
I do want to bring this back at some point, but I need to commission someone to remake the animations so I don't have to rip them from the SM64 ROM.
